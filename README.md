- 👋 Hi, I’m Brandon Nguyen, a Full-Stack Software engineer with a passion for building things from scratch! As a child I used legos to build things I like, but today I use Javascript and React, to build out cool web apps that I enjoy. 
- 👀 I’m interested in building Full-Stack web development but one day will get in to machine learning!
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Full stack technologies (Javascript, Node, and React)
